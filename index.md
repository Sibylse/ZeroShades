Welcome  to my page! I am Sibylle, assistant professor in the Data Mining group at TU Eindhoven in the Netherlands. I created this page to make a blog about the optimization challenges connected to clustering, which are usually matrix factorization objectives with binary constraints. This is why it's called the _Zero Shades of Grey_ page - it's all about obtaining black-and-white binary solutions. While the blog post content is accumulating only very slowly and I don't have any post properly finished to show, I have created quite a lot of other content. In particular, our lecture content which has been redesigned for online teaching is now also available on this site. Soon, I will also put online the content for our DSAA tutorial on matrix factorization with binary constraints. Hopefully, I will also be able to find some time to get the blog going. So, if you are interested, stay tuned :)
