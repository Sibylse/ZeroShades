Welcome  to my page! I am an assistant professor in the Data Mining group at TU Eindhoven in the Netherlands. I obtained my PhD in 2019 under supervision of Katharina Morik at the TU Dortmund in Germany.
During my PhD, I have been working in particular on matrix factorization objectives with binary constraints, which occur quite often in clustering. I am still working on the larger topic of optimization with binary constraints and I have recently delved into the topic of robust deep learning.
