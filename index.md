Welcome  to my page! I am Sibylle, assistant professor in the Data Mining group at TU Eindhoven in the Netherlands. I worked during my PhD a lot on solving optimization challenges connected to clustering, which are usually matrix factorization objectives with binary constraints. This is why it's called the _Zero Shades of Grey_ page - it's all about obtaining black-and-white binary solutions. Meanwhile, I developed also other interests, for example in deep learning. Yet, independent of the task, in classification as well as in clustering, I think the most fascinating question is how we can make models learn semantically meaningful latent spaces. Imposing binary constraints can help us interpret the representations of models and reduces model size. If only their optimization weren't so difficult, I believe we could be much further in our development of trustworthy models that actually learn the relations that we want them to learn.
