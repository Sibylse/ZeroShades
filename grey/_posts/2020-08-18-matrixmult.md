Matrix multiplication is weird. It's kind of basic but then again  not. If you know how to multiply matrices then you probably know how to perform this row-times-column scheme to get the result. But what does it mean? I'm gonna try to delve a bit intoo that. What are we doing when we multiply some matrices and how can we interpret the process? In addition, we'll have a look at the visual representation of matrix multiplication and how we can think about the process of row-times-column in more abstract terms.

<!---The main topic of this blog will be matrix factorization. Roughly, matrix factorization is the process of decomposing a matrix into _parts_, other matrices which have properties which can be used to gain information from the decomposed parts. The decomposed parts can be used to construct the whole ooriginal matrix (approoximately). This construction is in this case performed by matrix multiplication. I'd guess you probably had to multiply two matrices at least once in your life. If not, that's also fine, I will recap the basics. You might remember this seemingly overly complicated multiplication scheme of "row-times-column". I want to show you that matrix multiplication is actually more than this. It doesn't have to be so --->

But before that, let's have a look at the basics.
