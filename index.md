Welcome  to my page! I am an [assistant professor in the Data Mining group](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/sibylle-hess) at TU Eindhoven in the Netherlands. I obtained my PhD in 2019 under supervision of Katharina Morik at the TU Dortmund in Germany.
During my PhD, I have been working in particular on matrix factorization objectives with binary constraints, which occur quite often in clustering. I studied the optimization but also the automatic derivation of the number of clusters under quality garantees. I am still working on this topic but in a larger scope of general data mining optimization tasks with binary or other "nonsmooth" constraints and I have recently delved into the topic of robust deep learning.
