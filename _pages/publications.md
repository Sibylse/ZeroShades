    The PRIMPING routine — Tiling through proximal alternating linearized minimization
  </summary>
  <p>
  The Primping Routine introduces a novel optimization procedure for the combinatorial problem of Boolean Matrix Factorization (BMF), based on recent advances in nonconvex optimization. The proposed procedure has been the first to enable the highly parallel implementation of a BMF algorithm on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), replacing the so far used heuristic procedures. Furthermore, a minimum description length based criterion is introduced which enables an accurate automatic determination of the number of clusters. The introduced proximal operator for binary optimization has been extended for integer optimization in the scope of estimating exponential families

   k is the Magic Number — Inferring the Number of Clusters Through Nonparametric Concentration Inequalities 
  </summary>
  This paper extends the idea of \emph{the trustworthy pal} to select clusters based on the probability that a cluster is generated by noise effects to clusters in the real-valued vector space computed by $k$-means. Here, me and my co-author have proposed a bound on the question whether a cluster is likely to be part of another, overarching cluster. For real-valued clustering, comparable probability bounds exist, but only for specific (e.g., Gaussian) distributions of points within one cluster. Our novel bound does not require assumptions of specific probability distribution and relies only on easily computed parameters of the data, such as the mean and variance of points within each cluster. This makes our novel approach suitable for the application of clustering methods which work on a transformation of the input data such as \textsc{SpectACl}.

    The SpectACl of nonconvex clustering: a spectral approach to density-based clustering
  </summary> 
  This paper fills a long standing theoretical gap, showing why the application of $k$-means in Spectral Clustering is not only practically but also theoretically justified. This insight led to the proposal of a novel robust and feasible algorithm <i>SpectACl</i>. <i>SpectACl</i> is able to outperform more advanced and theoretically more expressive approaches which learn the similarity matrix simultaneously with the clustering.

    The trustworthy pal: Controlling the false discovery rate in boolean matrix factorization 
  </summary>
  In this paper, we provide the first criterion to determine the number of clusters in BMF based on probability theory. Me and my co-authors have   provided a probabilistic bound on the question "Given my data has <i>p\%</i> noise, how likely is this cluster (returned by my method of choice) mainly composed of noise?". This approach certifies the returned clustering in the sense that any of the clusters is only with a small (user-defined) probability an artifact of noise.
