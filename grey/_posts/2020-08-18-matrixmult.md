Ok, so this blog will be about matrix factorization. Factorization means that we are given the whole and we want to decompose it in easier parts. But, in order to being able to decompose, we also need to know how to construct the whole from its parts. This construction part is in this case the matrix multiplication. I'd guess that you probably know about matrix multiplication, that you might have an idea how to multiply two matrices. You might remember this seemingly overly complicated matrix multiplication scheme of "row-times-column". But matrix multiplication has actually more to offer than this. In fact, there is another way to compute a matrix multiplication, which actually gives meaning to the act in which two matrices are multiplied with each other.

But before we delve into all that, let's have a little recap what the basics of matrix factorizations were again.
