Ok, so this blog will be about matrix factorization. Factorization means that we are given a whole thing and we want to decompose it in smaller parts, which are more easy to handle/understand. Yet, being able to decompose also requires to construct the whole from its parts. This construction part is in this case the matrix multiplication. I'd guess that you probably have an idea how to multiply two matrices. You might remember this seemingly overly complicated multiplication scheme of "row-times-column". I want to show you that matrix multiplication is actually more than this. It doesn't have to be so 

But before we delve into all that, let's have a little recap what the basics of matrix factorizations were again.
